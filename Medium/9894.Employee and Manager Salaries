# CODE THAT I WROTE NOT WORKING
# THANKS GingerSnaps166 FOR CODE IN LINE ON
# MY CODE DIFFERENT IN ON M.ID = E.MANAGER_ID, FIRST IT WAS E.ID = M.ID
# WHY JOIN ON M.ID = E.MANAGER_ID, BECAUSE WE WANT TO ADD EMPLOYEE WITH TITLE MANAGER OR HAVE MANAGER ID, 
# ADDING WHO HAVE ID MANAGER SAME WITH ID EMPLOYEE TO TABLE COLUMN (NOT ROW), THEN COMPARE EMPLOYEE SALARY AND MANAGER SALARY

select e.first_name
        ,e.salary
from employee as e
join (select *
      from employee
      where employee_title = 'Manager'
      ) as m
on m.id = e.manager_id
where e.salary > m.salary

# THIS CODE IS FROM GingerSnaps166
# MORE SIMPLE
select *
    from employee e
    join employee m
    on m.id=e.manager_id
    where e.salary > m.salary
