# MY SOLUTION
# SO MUCH WORK

           GROUP BY department
           having department = 'engineering')
         as difference
from db_employee

# OTHER SOLUTION
# MORE EFFICIENT
# THANKS jackhyena for the solution
select abs(max(a.salary) - max(b.salary)) as sal_diff
from db_employee a, db_employee b
where a.department_id = 4 and b.department_id = 1;

# THIS ONE SAME WITH MY SOLUTION BUT BETTER
# THANKS
SELECT
  ABS((SELECT max(salary)
   FROM db_employee emp
   JOIN db_dept dept ON emp.department_id = dept.id
   WHERE department = 'engineering') -
  (SELECT max(salary)
   FROM db_employee emp
   JOIN db_dept dept ON emp.department_id = dept.id
   WHERE department = 'marketing')) AS salary_diffe;
   
# FOR MY SOLUTION NEED TO DELETE FROM DB_EMPLOYEE FROM MAIN SELECT AND CHANGE DISTINCT TO ABS
